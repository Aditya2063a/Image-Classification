# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with Keras

This project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with Keras and TensorFlow. The workflow includes data loading and visualization, model creation, training, saving, and inference on sample images.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset:** CIFAR-10 â€“ 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
- **Objective:** Build and train a CNN to classify images into one of 10 classes.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset.
  - Visualize sample images from the dataset.
  - Construct a CNN model with convolutional, dropout, pooling, and dense layers.
  - Train the model and evaluate its performance.
  - Save sample images from each class.
  - Use the trained model for inference on new images.
